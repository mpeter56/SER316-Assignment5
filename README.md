## Patern 1
I will use the factory pattern to generate wild code-a-mon, by having a random number generator
pick a number assigned to a code-a-mon and then have the factory return the code-a-mon associated 
with that number.

## Patern 2
I will use the decorator pattern to evolve code-a-mon by having the decorator add the evolution to
the original code-a-mon.

##Patern 3
I will use the mediator pattern to haddle object communication for battles which will be on a turn
based system.
